# TorDar (Tornado Radar)

Tornado Radar (TorDar for short) is currently in devolpment and is based off of Supercell WX, which is free and open source. TorDar will feature a more modern and updated UI than Supercell WX.

Go check out Supercell WX here: https://github.com/dpaulat/supercell-wx

More updates will be shown here for devolpment, as well as a trailer on YouTube once TorDar is ready to be released into Beta.

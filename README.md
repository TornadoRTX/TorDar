# TorDar (Tornado Radar)

Tornado Radar (TorDar for short) is currently in devolpment and is a fork of Supercell WX, which is free and open source. TorDar will feature a more modern and updated UI than Supercell WX.

Go check out Supercell WX here: https://github.com/dpaulat/supercell-wx

TorDar will only be available on Windows at launch, but may be fitted to other operating systems at a later date. (Not guaranteed)

More updates will be shown here for devolpment, as well as a trailer on YouTube once TorDar is ready to be released into Beta.

This is the current vision and blueprint for TorDar:

![TorDar Blueprint](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da3fca3b-2394-428e-a8c0-08aec2aaea99)

A ton of elements have been taken from the radar program Ryan Hall Y'all built.

This blueprint is not the final version and may change.

Any and all feedback is appreciated.

This will take some time to make as I am one person.

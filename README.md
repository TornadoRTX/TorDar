Supercell Wx is a free, open source application to visualize live and archive
NEXRAD Level 2 and Level 3 data, and severe weather alerts. It displays
continuously updating weather data on top of a responsive map, providing the
capability to monitor weather events using reflectivity, velocity, and other
products.

Please be sure to check out the documentation before getting started: [Supercell Wx Documentation](https://supercell-wx.rtfd.io/)

## FAQ

Frequently asked questions:

- Q: Why is the map black when loading for the first time?

  - A. You must obtain a free API key from either (or both) [MapTiler](https://cloud.maptiler.com/auth/widget?next=https://cloud.maptiler.com/maps/) which currently does not require a credit/debit card, or [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/) which ***does*** require a credit/debit card, but as of writing, you will receive 200K free requests per month, which should be sufficient for an individual user.

- Q: Why is it that when I change my color table, API key, grid width/height settings, nothing happens after hitting apply?

  - A. As of right now, you must restart Supercell Wx in order to apply these changes. In future iterations, this will no longer be an issue.

- Q. Is it possible to get dark mode?

  - A. In Windows, make sure to set the flag `-style fusion` at the end of the target path of the .exe
    - Example: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Supercell-Wx\bin\supercell-wx.exe -style fusion`
  - A. In Linux, if you're using KDE, Supercell Wx should automatically follow your theme settings.

- Q: How can I contribute?
  - A. Head to [Developer Setup](https://supercell-wx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/developer-setup.html) and [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to configure the Supercell Wx development environment for your IDE. Currently Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are recommended, with other IDEs remaining untested at this time.

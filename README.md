# TorDar (Tornado Radar)

Tornado Radar (TorDar for short) is currently in devolpment and is a fork of Supercell WX, which is free and open source. TorDar will feature a more modern and updated UI than Supercell WX.

Go check out Supercell WX here: https://github.com/dpaulat/supercell-wx

TorDar will only be available on Windows at launch, but may be fitted to other operating systems at a later date. (Not guaranteed)

More updates will be shown here for devolpment, as well as a trailer on YouTube once TorDar is ready to be released into Beta.

This is the current vision and blueprint for TorDar, and also the full version of the blueprint:

# Unollapsed Version

# Collapsed Version

A ton of elements have been taken from the radar program Ryan Hall Y'all built.

This blueprint is not the final version and may change.

Any and all feedback is appreciated.

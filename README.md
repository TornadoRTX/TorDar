# TorDar (Tornado Radar)

Tornado Radar (TorDar for short) is currently in devolpment and is a fork of Supercell WX, which is free and open source. TorDar will feature a more modern and updated UI than Supercell WX.

Go check out Supercell WX here: https://github.com/dpaulat/supercell-wx

TorDar will only be available on Windows at launch, but may be fitted to other operating systems at a later date. (Not guaranteed)

More updates will be shown here for devolpment, as well as a trailer on YouTube once TorDar is ready to be released into Beta.

TorDar aims to keep most, if not all of the features Supercell WX has. However, this may not be the case for the first few publicly released versions.

This is the current vision and blueprint for TorDar, and also the full version of the blueprint:

# Uncollapsed Blueprint

# Collapsed Blueprint

A ton of elements have been taken from the radar program Ryan Hall Y'all built.

This blueprint is not the final version and may change.
